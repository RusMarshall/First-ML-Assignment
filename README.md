This is the first assignment of the Machine Learning course 

# Structure of the project
It consists of "main.py" module and 2 another modules

```
├── main.py               <- driver program file 
├── Algorithms.py         <- module with algorithms methods 
├── Data_Operations.py    <- module for data preparation
└── Readme.md
```
# Necessary libraries
```
sklearn
numpy
matplotlib
pandas

```
or download ```.zip``` file

2) Open or download IDE like "pyCharm" after go to ```File -> open -> First-ML-Assignment``` folder
